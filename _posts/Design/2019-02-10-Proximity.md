## Proximity
![enter description here](https://www.github.com/zhongpenggeo/Blogs/raw/master/imags/1546134794145.png)    

#### Problem
- the item is not related to each other
- not clear where you should begin reading;
- not clear where you are finished.

#### Conparison
- align
- repeting with different font
- preximioty with related elements/items

### Summary

#### 1. how to get it
If there are more than three to five items on the pages, see which of the seperarte elements can be grouped together into closer proximity to become one visual unit.

#### 2. what to avoid
- too many separated elements (should group into several sets?)
- leaving equal amounts of white space between elements unless each group is part of related subset.(tree structure?)
- a split second of confusion over headlines subhead and others.
- create relationships casually. 
- stick things in the corners or in the middle just because the space is empty.
