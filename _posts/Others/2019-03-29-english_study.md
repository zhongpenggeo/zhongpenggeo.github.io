### some tricks

English learning is a long-term, difficult and boring process. So I must find some ways to make it easier and  more interesting. Here are some of my tricks:

1. For listening english, find some wonderful voice to train your listening, e.g, the beautiful sound I have heard is the dub in *he is a dragon*, a Russian movie presented in 2015, and the voice actress for Mira is so abstract that I was absorbed in. Then I spent much time to look for some audiobooks narrated by charming female voice. And I observed that **Jenna Lamia** is a good reader in audiobooks on websites. Then I also noticed that there is a free audio websites which include volunteers of readers and listeners, which means I can get some free audiobooks on it. Great discover.
