### Draft
1. **Create an outline or bullet list**: There are different ways to write outlines, both formal and informal. However you write your outline, it's good to create a plan for your writing. What will the order of ideas be? Why are they in that order?
2. **Write your introduction**: Begin writing. Your introduction should draw your reader in, make your topic clear, and lead to your thesis. Make it interesting! Whether you're writing a personal statement or an academic essay, the introduction helps your reader understand what to expect.
3. **Craft your paragraphs**: Each paragraph should focus on a main idea that supports your main idea or topic. If you are writing a letter of application, each paragraph should be relevant to the application, and not go off on other topics. 
4. **End with your conclusion**: Give your writing a satisfying ending, whether it's a traditional conclusion to an essay, or a polite closing to a business letter.
