## Prewriting methods
### 1. Cubing
"Cubing" means looking at a topic from six different perspectives, like the six sides of a cube. 
- **Describe** your topic
- **Compare** your topic to other related topics. How is it similar or different? 
- **Associate** your topic with another topic. In other words, what does your topic make you think about? It might be something unexpected. Be creative.
- **Analyze** the parts of your topic. How do they fit together? What do the parts say about the topic? Are all the parts equally important? 
- **Apply** your topic--what can you do with it? How is it useful? Who might use it? Who wouldn't use it?
- **Argue** for and against your topic. What are its benefits? How might someone disagree with your topic? 

### 2. Matrix
A matrix is a table of information. Along one side, you can have different main points of your topic, and across the top, perhaps some questions or points relevant to your topic.  Then, in each cell,  fill out the relevant information. 

### 3. Interview
imagine that your topic is a person and interview with him  

#### Example : Train travel
1. What is your full name? Do some people know you by a different name?

I am known as train travel, rail travel, riding the train, or railroad travel.

2. How does the dictionary or encyclopedia define you?

I am a type of movement from one place to another--usually different cities or countries--using a self-propelled machine and a set of connected cars called a train. The train travels on metal tracks.

3. When were you born? What were the circumstances?

The machine powered version of me was born in the 1800s, around the time of the Industrial Revolution. People were looking for faster ways of traveling.
