## grammar
Avoid grammar mistake, or  your readers can not see the way you are saying it. You will distract them from what you are trying to say.  
proposition is very difficult for non-native english writer.

### Wordiness
use too many words than you need is wordiness.
- **Trying to sound too formal or academic. **Unfortunately, in academic and business writing, there are a lot of examples of wordy writing. This doesn't mean you have to model your writing on bad examples. Your readers will always appreciate if you state your ideas clearly, using no more words than necessary.
- **Not knowing more precise vocabulary.** For example, saying, She ran quickly to the store can be made less wordy, and more precise, by saying: She raced to the store (race=run quickly). Finding the right vocabulary can help you cut down the number of words you use. Every reduction helps, even if it's only a word or two.
- **Using too many unnecessary and vague modifiers. **Modifiers like really, very, quite, and similar words add no meaning to your writing. If you need to modify a word, find precise modifiers. For example, instead of "There's a really tall building near my house," write: "There's a 50-story building near my house."  
- **Using too many prepositional phrases or possessives. **These types of phrases can add length to your sentences, often unnecessarily. So, instead of The car belonging to Mr. Wang is in the garage [10 words], write: Mr. Wang's car is in the garage [7 words].
